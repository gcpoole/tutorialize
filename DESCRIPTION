Title: Automate creation of simple learnr tutorials
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Geoffrey Poole
Maintainer: The package maintainer <gpoole@montana.edu>
Description: Tutorialize takes ordinary .Rmd files, structured as "answer keys"
    and converts them to simple R markdown tutorials.  The advantage tutorialize
    offers over writing tutorials directly is that an exercise, its solutions 
    and grading can be managed from a single code chunk rather than coordinating
    among three code chunks.  Code chucks interpreted by tutorialize can be 
    mixed with standard learnr exercises, maintaining flexibility for edge
    cases on how exercises should work.
